# In HTML we need to abide the rules of syntax to properly create buttons, paragraphs
* We need to have opening tag and closing tag, in between we have content or text
* We can also create anchor element, which is the link to another website
* We just need to pass the link to href attribute
* Next we can pass another attribute, the target, which tells that the link can be open in current page or in the new 
* If we don't pass anything it will open in current page and if we pass _blank it will open in new 

# Paragraph, button and link had their own set of attributes that we can modify inside tag

# Next i create paragraph, button and link to pancakes recipy
* And then another link to but flower, where i include paragraph of text and 2 buttons  

# Next i gonna learn how to provide correct structure of HTML
* First we want to add at the top of our code the special line <!DOCTYPE html>
* It tells our browser to use modern version of HTML
* When we have an element inside another element its called nesting
* If we have a text element inside a paragraph, it allows us to have some text in the paragraph which styles differently

# Then we create HTML element - <html>
* Every file has only 1 html element and these element represent the entire web page
* These element is design to contain 1 head element and 1 body element
