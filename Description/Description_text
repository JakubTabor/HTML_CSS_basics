# In here i gonna practise different styles of text 
* I start by changing the font from Times New Roman to Arial
* Next i change the size of text, make the text bolder and change style to italic
* Then i want to center the text, to do this i need to set the property text-align to center
* It can be alight as well to left or right
* Next if we set a width, we are gonna force the text to a second line
* Then to add spacing between the lines we call property line-height
