# In here i gonna practise different styles of text 
* I start by changing the font from Times New Roman to Arial
* Next i change the size of text, make the text bolder and change style to italic
* Then i want to center the text, to do this i need to set the property text-align to center
* It can be alight as well to left or right
* Next if we set a width, we are gonna force the text to a second line
* Then to add spacing between the lines we call property line-height

# Next we are gonna create new paragraph of text
* First we are gonna search for code to get HTML dot and add it to the text in paragraph
* And we add a class video-stats to style it
* I change some margin and set color of text using inspect function 

# Then i add a paragraph with a name and check mark
* I take the code for this special sign and put in into paragraph
* Color and font-size are in the same type as previous paragraphs

# And i add also video description paragraph 
* I add the margin and now the description match the rest of the paragraphs
* It is important to set by hand all margins, to fit everything
