# Now i gonna create 3 buttons
* The syntax rules are following:
* The word button is CSS selector and it tells which element we are targeting
* Inside brackets are CSS property - background-color, it tells what we are changing
* And next is CSS value, it tells what we are changing property to

# So we are changing property - background color to red
* What's important we can choose the color in the color box
* We can also set rgb (red, green, blue) percentage
* Next we are changing property of text color to white 
* Another will be broder property and we set it to none
* We also change height to 36 pixels and width to 105 pixels
* Next we are gonna make rounded corners, by set border-radius, which is pixel measurement
* The higher the pixels the more round corners will be
* And we want also to change the cursor to pinter

# We create button with HTML and set the style with CSS 
* Next we create class with HTML and then call the property to modify it
