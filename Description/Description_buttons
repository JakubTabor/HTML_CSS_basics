# Now i gonna create 3 buttons
* The syntax rules are following:
* The word button is CSS selector and it tells which element we are targeting
* Inside brackets are CSS property - background-color, it tells what we are changing
* And next is CSS value, it tells what we are changing property to

# So we are changing property - background color to red
* What's important we can choose the color in the color box
* We can also set rgb (red, green, blue) percentage
* Next we are changing property of text color to white 
* Another will be broder property and we set it to none
* We also change height to 36 pixels and width to 105 pixels
* Next we are gonna make rounded corners, by set border-radius, which is pixel measurement
* The higher the pixels the more round corners will be
* And we want also to change the cursor to pinter

# We create button with HTML and set the style with CSS 
* Next we create class with HTML and then call the property to modify it
* Then we create join button as well as previous one

# The space between our 2 buttons is called margin 
* And we can make it on left and right, by number of pixels

# And finally we are gonna crete third button which will be tweet button
* To get rounded border we need to set the border-radius to half of border high or width

# And now we are gonna check how to change the style of our buttons when we hover over mouse on them
* First we need to target the class of our button and pass hover
* And inside we can pass the style when we hover over the button
* To make the effect of fade away we are gonna pass the opacity property
* Opacity is in range 0-1, the less the more it fade away

# We can also add pseudo-class, which is active, it means that it activate when we click on the element
* And we set the opacity to 0.5, so when we click the button it gets lighter

# Another will be join button, we want to invert the colors
* To do this we are gonna set the background color to our text color
* And set the text color to the background color
* And we also make the join button when we click it fades out

# Next we are gonna make transitions smoothly between 2 styles not instantly
* We can make it in the style subscribe-button, the property transition
* And inside transition we specify what we want transition, it is opacity
* Next will be how long the transition will take, we set it to 0.15 second
* We also add transition to the join button, it will be background-color to 0.15 second
* And we change in join button the text color transition to 0.15 second and we separate both with comma 
* We can also put the transition property into the hover, but it will only apply when we hover
